## 2026-11-10: audit and plan (IMP-0.1)

- Six read-only auditors ran in parallel, one per area: rendering, motion, components, agent tooling,
  platform and measurement. The results are in AUDIT.md.
- The baseline came from `cargo xtask bench` at 393afe0, on an Apple M5 Pro through memgate (peak 2.57
  GB, 3m44s). The numbers are in AUDIT.md §1. A future `--compare` needs this baseline file, so keep a
  copy as `target/bench/baseline-393afe0.json` on the integrating machine.
- The reference framework was **not built**: building downloaded code needs the owner's go-ahead.
  Its head-to-head column uses its published numbers. Measuring it is IMP-1.9.
- Decision: no gate in the repository checks for the other framework's name; the owner asked for it
  not to be committed. Every staged diff and commit message is checked by hand instead.
- Decision: measure first. Phase 1 baselines (IMP-1.4, IMP-1.5) must land before the fixes they
  measure (IMP-2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8).
- Verified by re-reading the code before planning:
  - the caret-blink repaint (egui `paint_text_cursor`)
  - per-frame `update_title`/`persist_view` work (`crates/app/src/runtime.rs:768-823`)
  - the linear `Notes::get` (`examples/notes/src/lib.rs:38-40`)
